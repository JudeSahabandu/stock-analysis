# Analysis of Green Stocks for client Steve
---

## Project Overview

### Stock Analysis Requirement

Steve is a recently graduated stock analyst, upon graduation he is in the process of reviewing his parents investment portfolio. With his parents keen on upcoming green energy stock, they had a special emphasis on investing in the DQ ticker. But, the goal is to diversify the investment portfolio, so this analysis looks at 12 selected greenstocks and assesses the following;

1. The total volume of stocks traded in 2017 and 2018
2. The annual return for each stock in 2017 and 2018

### Methodology - Data Analysis

To analyse the selected ticker data, we use VBA to write code and obtain the desired output. Our initial run of code has seperate loops running through the 2017 and 2018 data sheets, causing inefficiencies in output. But, a goal of this analysis is to refactor the code into a single loop and determine how effectively it runs compared to our code with multiple loops.

This sections below highlight the approach towards refactoring code in VBA for the stock analysis.

## Results
